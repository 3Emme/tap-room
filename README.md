# __ParksApi__

#### __An API for states and national parks. October 30, 2020__

#### By _**Emme Buentiempo**_

## Description

This application was created as an Epicodus assignment, with the intent to have it serve as a demonstration of knowledge after the program's 13th week. For the time being this README will serve as a checklist to demonstrate the satisfaction of all project requirements and objectives. 

## Project requirements:

This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain or another kind of tracker - as long as you're able to track the remaining amount and meet the objectives, you can be creative with this prompt.

Before getting started, plan out your application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in your README. You may draw the structure on a piece of paper and take a picture of it or use an application like https://www.draw.io/.

Here are some user stories to get you started. The application should have the following functionality:

As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store). [Complete]
As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list. [Complete]
As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page. [Complete]
As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints. [Incomplete]
As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0. [Incomplete]

## Project Objectives:

  * Application compiles and runs and all required functionality is included. [Incomplete]
  * Functional and class components are used correctly. [Complete]
  * Application effectively uses local and shared state. [Complete]
  * Props are used correctly and always include PropTypes. [Complete]
  * README includes an accurate representation of the application's component tree. [Incomplete]
  * Project was submitted by the deadline. [Incomplete]
  * Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology. [Complete]

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
